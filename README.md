Describes what a recreational sponsorship agreement is like
## Recreational Sponsorship Agreement (example)
Sponsorship agreement of $2/mo paid to another person,
to sponsor the shared recreational experience,
of using a Google Play app together for fun.

*Sponsorship is not a job. Working for Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) starts at $10/hr or equivalent. Sponsorship means that I like the work you do and I want to contribute money in a loose low stress agreement.
â€ $2/mo is equivalent to the cost of [equivalent in app resource cost]/mo in [Google Play app]. Helping you continue doing what you contribute in [Google Play app] is worth more than [equivalent in app resource cost]/mo to me. I am only able to pay sponsorship at $2/mo at this time. We are only playing [Google Play app] together. This is not a business agreement. We are not buying, selling or trading [Google Play app] resources. I have created an exchange rate value system that exchanges the energy you put into [Google Play app] as part of my recreational experience, and compares the money paid to an amount of [Google Play app] [equivalent in app resource cost]/mo. No [equivalent in app resource cost]/mo are being exchanged. [Google Play app] is a recreational mobile app. We are sharing a recreational experience. I am willing to sponsor part of your recreational experience. The contributions you make outside of [Google Play app] are currently relevant to sharing the recreational experience in [Google Play app]. Discord is commonly used for the same exact purpose to collaborate while using [Google Play app]. If you have interest in working with me outside of using [Google Play app] for recreation, then you would have to explicitly request that type of relationship change.
